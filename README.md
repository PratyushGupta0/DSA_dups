Range update and range query using BIT -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-indexed-tree-range-update-range-queries/<br>
Upper bound on prefix sum -> https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/61364
2D BIT -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/two-dimensional-binary-indexed-tree-or-fenwick-tree/<br>
Binary Lifting in BIT -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuUspQ7ORXE
Sparse tables -> https://aquarchitect.github.io/swift-algorithm-club/Sparse%20Table/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EpX9LkO2T0

- BIT easy to use compared to Segment trees.
- BIT can be used only for functions whose inverse can be calculated s.t f(0, r) * f(0, l) = f(l, r) where * operation is the inverse. Useful for sum, product, XOR etc.
- Sparse tables can be used for range query problems given that we don't have updates. NlogN build, O(logn) query. However if the function is idempotent i.e. f(a, a) = a then query can be done in O(1) time.
- Segment trees can handle all of the above but are difficult to implement compared to above.

Given an array of size N. Q queries given L, R, X (L, R 1-indexed),  Return the maximum number between indices(both inclusive) L and R which have X set bits in binary representation.
Ex: A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Q = 1, => [3, 5, 2] => 3, 4, 5 fall in L, R. 3 & 5 have 2 set bits, maximum of which is 5. Return 5.
